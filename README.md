I developed a Command Line Interface (CLI) Calculator in Python that performs basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each operation is defined as a separate function for modularity.
A main calculator() function handles user input, displays options, and performs calculations in a loop until the user exits.
I used tryâ€“except blocks for safe input handling and error prevention.
The line if __name__ == "__main__": calculator() ensures the program runs only when executed directly, not when imported as a module.
